# Overview (Data Pack)

Origins is a Minecraft mod for the Fabric loader that enhances gameplay by allowing players to select an **Origin** at the start of the game. Each Origin provides unique abilities and challenges, encouraging creative approaches to the game.

```json
{
    "powers": [
        "origins:fire_immunity",
        "origins:elytra",
        "origins:throw_ender_pearl",
        "origins:fresh_air"
    ],
    "icon": "minecraft:slime_ball",
    "order": 4,
    "impact": 1,
    "name": "Supermorph",
    "description": "Supermorphs are versatile beings immune to fire and capable of flight."
}
```
Using JSON files like this, you can create your own Origins or modify existing ones to customize gameplay to your liking.

You can use Origins to add depth to Minecraft. Want to give players the ability to phase through walls like the Phantom? Or perhaps make an Origin that can breathe underwater like the Merling? The mod makes it all possible through its data-driven system.

These pages serve as a reference for creating and customizing Origins. If you're new to the mod, start by exploring the following sections which contain detailed documentation, or join the [Origins Discord Server](https://discord.gg/4mTMHu3) to connect with other creators and players.
